>## HOW YOU CAN REVIEW RECORDED INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
>You have the right to review certain recorded information about you contained in our files, either in person or to obtain a copy by mail, whichever you prefer. That information must be reasonably described by you and must be reasonably locatable and retrievable by us. If you have any questions about that information, please write us at the address at the end of this notice. We will need your complete name, address, date of birth, and all policy numbers under which you are insured. Tell us the information you would like to receive. Within 30 days of receipt of your request, we will contact you and inform you of the nature of such recorded information about you in our files. At that time, we will also tell you the identity of the persons or organizations, if any, to whom we have disclosed this information in the preceding two years. We will also give you the name and address of any consumer reporting agency who prepared a report about you in our files so that you can contact them to get a copy of that report. There are some kinds of information, however, that we are not required to give you access to. This type of information is generally collected when we evaluate a claim under an insurance policy or when the possibility of a lawsuit exists.

>## IF YOU DISAGREE WITH OUR RECORDS
>If, after reading the information in your file, you believe it is incorrect, please notify us. Tell us what is inaccurate and why. You have the right to request that we correct, amend or delete information that you feel is incorrect. Upon receiving your request, we will reinvestigate the information you think is incorrect. If we agree with you, we will make the necessary corrections, amendments or deletions. We will also notify persons or organizations to whom we have previously disclosed the inaccurate information of the change. Insurance-support organizations to whom we systematically reveal information will also be informed of the change. If we disagree with you, we will notify you and give you our reasons for refusing to correct, amend or delete the information you feel is incorrect. If you are not satisfied by our refusal and the reasons, you have the right to place a statement in our files explaining why you believe the information is incorrect. In that case, we will ask you to send us a concise statement of what you believe is the correct information and why you disagree with our refusal to correct it. When we receive your statement, we will place it in our file and send a copy of it to persons and organizations to whom we have previously disclosed or systematically disclose information. If we make any subsequent disclosure of information in your file, we will also disclose your statement.
